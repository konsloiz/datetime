# datetime
A simple containerized service to get the current date &amp; time

## Task Overview 

Create a small web service, in the language of your choice, which provides the current date and time under /now in a standard format. It should also be possible to request the date and time in at least one different format. The service needs to run inside a container on a local Kubernetes cluster. We would suggest to use kind. The deployment of the service needs to be performed via Terraform. Furthermore, you should also write a script, in a different language of your choice, which can be run externally to check the health of your service: if it is up and running and the clock is not desynchronized by more than 5 seconds. Automate as much as you can. Assume that your work will be reviewed by developers which are good at writing software but have no prior knowledge about containers, k8s and Terraform, so document accordingly.
